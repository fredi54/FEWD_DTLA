###Lesson #4.5 - Feb 17, 2016


"You don't start out writing good stuff. You start out writing crap and thinking it's good stuff, and then gradually you get better at it. That's why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler">Octavia E. Butler</a>

##Review + Exit Tickets

*	Is there a resource online of developers to reach out to for advice outside of GA i.e. reddit? 

Answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>

* 	Tips for organizing stylesheets.

Answer: Organize your styles per content section / page; use comments to make it clear what the following block of styles is for.  Use <a href="http://tools.maxcdn.com/procssor/">Procssor</a> to ensure your CSS is squeaky clean.

*	Is it correct to think of elements as containers? 

Answer: Yep!

* 	When youâ€™re typing up a tag in sublime and a drop down appears, is that all of the options for that tag? Or just the main ones?

Answer: SublimeText's autocomplete functionality is based on commonly used tags/properties as well as any code that you also write (especially important for CSS and JS).
