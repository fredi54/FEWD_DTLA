###Submitting Assignments

1.	Upload your project to GitHub (following the steps to create a new repository, add project files, and sync/publish to GitHub).
2.	Get the link for your project and Slack it to **BOTH** Emma and Sam.
3.	You will receive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQzWFRKZUSA&feature=youtu.be&hd=1">feedback</a> via in-line comments within your latest commit on GitHub on your project's repository.  Assessment rubrics for larger projects will be provided in GitHub issues.


### Final Project info
In order to complete the FEWD successfully, you will demonstrate what you have learned throughout the course by submitting a final project showcasing your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.  You will be working on this throughout the course as you gain new skills and you will be asked to submit work at various stages of your project.

Please have a look at the <a href="Final_Project/final_project_requirements.md">Final Project specs</a> and start thinking about what kind of site you want to build for your final project -- the sooner you have an idea of what you want to build, the easier it will be for you to plan for a successful final project!
