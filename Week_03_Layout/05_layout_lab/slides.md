##Review + Exit Tickets

*	More on creating buttons: `<a>` vs `<button>`

Answer: Use `<a>` if you're linking the user to another page; use `<button>` for form submissions and JavaScript interactions. Read more <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/html5-buttons">here</a>. 

*	Can you pull images from other hosting sites like Dropbox etc? 

Answer: Yep!  You can use the link to full path for the file as the value of the `src` attribute.

*	Responsive layout and scaling

Answer: We will return to this in greater depth in the third unit of this course

##Review + Exit Tickets

*	Is there a downside to hosting files on GitHub Pages that we should be aware of?

Answer: For hosting static files, not really!

*	Will the assignments in the future have the normalize/reset in them?

Answer: For future assignments, you will want to continue to use normalize/reset.

*	Why did the hero get its own container inside of the div container?

Answer: the `#container` div contains *everything* on the page (all sections); we put the hero in its own container so that we could apply a unique background to just that element.

*	Do you have any mobile app suggestions for quick reviews and/or practices on HTML and CSS?

Answer: I recommend continuing to practice by building your own sites.  <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> is also a nice way to sandbox some quick ideas + look at other people's code.

## Alternative to `float`

###`display: inline-block`

Apply `display: inline-block` to elements that you want to lay side-by-side.  `inline-block` can be used to achieve an effect similar to `float` but without all the messiness of needing to clear `float`.


---
## Pseudo-classes

###A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected.

###`a:hover`

You can style a certain state for a selector using the pseudo-classes; the above would apply styles to an `<a>` element when the user hovers over the element.

##Relaxr Diagramming
