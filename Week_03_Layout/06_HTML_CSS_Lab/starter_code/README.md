###Colors

This design uses the colors that correspond to `yellow`, `black`, and `white` keywords.  Feel free to choose different colors if you like.

The grey that's used for the background under the nav and the buttons in the 3 column layout is `#C6C6C6`.

###Hints

There are a few tags and properties you will need to utilize that we haven't yet discussed in class.  Here are a couple of hints:

*	shadow under the buttons and around the "Meet your match" box - there is a particular CSS property that will handle this for you...
*	strike-through on "taste" in the area under the nav - there is an HTML tag that will achieve this effect (and a corresponding tag for the "are" text following the strike-through text)
