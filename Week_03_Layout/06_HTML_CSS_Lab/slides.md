"What we find is that if you have a goal that is very, very far out, and you approach it in little steps, you start to get there faster. Your mind opens up to the possibilities."

##Review + Exit Tickets

*	When do you use floats and when do you use inline-block?

Answer: You can use them interchangably.  There's no official "best practice" on this; floats pre-date inline-block, but you still see people using them sometimes.  Recommendation is to use inline-block whenever you need an inline layout (elements side-by-side).  Read more <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15172520/advantages-of-using-displayinline-block-vs-floatleft-in-css">here</a>.

*	What is your opinion on Pagecloud and their layout techniques?

Answer: I'm personally not that familiar with Pagecloud, but most design apps that generate code tend to leave a considerable amount of code bloat.  This can be fine if you are just putting up a simple landing page. 

*	how would you use a different domain name when you host on github?

Answer: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">Official documentation</a> from GitHub themselves!

*	What exactly does the block in inline-block do, and/or mean semantically? 

Answer: The `block` in `inline-block` means that the element may accept the kinds of styling that you can apply to `block` elements (but won't be styled for `inline` elements like `a` or `span`).  Read more <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8969381/what-is-the-difference-between-display-inline-and-display-inline-block">here</a>.

*	What is the `<meta charset="utf-8">`?

Answer: Expands the character set that can be used for the page so that special symbols/other language symbols can be used.

*	can a site have multiple header styles and even if it is possible to do that, it doesn't seem like an example of best practice

Answer: Correct on both counts.  You *could* do it in theory, but it's not a good idea to.  Will update the solution code for the first Relaxr Assignment to reflect this!
