##Review + Exit Tickets

* For the image, is there a way to change the size through CSS or do you have to import the image with the size already modified to how you want big you want it. 

Answer: GREAT question!  We'll be talking about spacing, etc. further this week, including the `width` CSS property (which you can totally use with `img`s).

*	Specifying file paths

Answer: this will take time + practice.  One thing to note, absolute path values will be hard to preview in local development, so I would recommend using **relative** paths for the time being.

##Tip: Commenting

###As you work through some of the exercises & assignments, it may be useful for you to leave notes to yourself in your code

###Commenting in HTML

Use `<!--` to start commenting and `-->` to close your comments.

Ex:

`<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->`


###Commenting in CSS

Use `/*` to start commenting and `*/` to close your comments.

Ex:

`/* This is a comment in CSS */`

##Box Model

Every element in web design is a box.

##Box Model

---

##Box Model

###Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right

###Height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom

### *margin properties add additional space OUTSIDE of the box in question (and also contribute to the overal width & height of your element)

##Draw Me a DOM

###In groups of 2-3, whiteboard a DOM tree for the Relaxr landing page.

####You may find that you need to nest tags together within each `section` on the page, but we haven't yet talked about how to group content.  We will be talking about various ways to achive this next class, but in anticipation of that, you may want to look up `section` or `div` tags.

##Relaxr Landing Page

Begin working on the Assignment for this week, building the Relaxr Landing Page from the <a href="https://github.com/ga-students/FEWD_DTLA_7/blob/master/Week_02_Styling/03_box_model/images/relaxr_landing.jpg">design file</a>.

For today, focus on building out the HTML structure and applying the styles that we've learned so far.  On Wednesday, we will talk more specifically about how to visually organize information.

You will have more time to work on this before submitting it as the Assignment for this week, so don't feel rushed!
